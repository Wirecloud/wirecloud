Convert between positions (line and column-based) and offsets
(range-based) locations in a [virtual file][vfile].

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install vfile-location
```

## Usage

```js
var vfile = require('vfile')
var vfileLocation = require('vfile-location')

var location = vfileLocation(vfile('foo\nbar\nbaz'))

var offset = location.toOffset({line: 3, column: 3}) // => 10
location.toPosition(offset) // => {line: 3, column: 3, offset: 10}
```

## API

### `location = vfileLocation(doc)`

Get transform functions for the given `doc` (`string`) or
[`file`][vfile].

Returns an object with [`toOffset`][to-offset] and
[`toPosition`][to-position].

### `location.toOffset(position)`

Get the `offset` (`number`) for a line and column-based
[`position`][position] in the bound file.  Returns `-1`
when given invalid or out of bounds input.

### `location.toPosition(offset)`

Get the line and column-based [`position`][position] for `offset` in
the bound file.
