MIME-Type Parser

This module provides basic functions for handling mime-types. It can handle
matching mime-types against a list of media-ranges. See section 14.1 of the
HTTP specification [RFC 2616] for a complete explanation.

   http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.1

Contents:
 - parse_mime_type():   Parses a mime-type into its component parts.
 - parse_media_range(): Media-ranges are mime-types with wild-cards and a 'q'
                          quality parameter.
 - best_match():        Choose the mime-type with the highest quality ('q')
                          from a list of candidates.
