## Introduction

Object Storage offers persistent storage for binary objects. Objects are stored in named locations known as containers. Containers can be nested thus objects can be stored hierarchically. The main aim of this section is to show an example that allows you to understand how to use this API.

## Adding ObjectStorage support to widgets/operators

If you want to use this feature, first of all you have to modify your `config.xml` file and add a new `Feature` named **ObjectStorage** within Requirements. For example, if you use XML to set up the configuration of your widget, your code should look similar to the following one. Note that we have also added a preference that will be useful to store the KeyStone server URL.

	!xml
	<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
	<widget xmlns="http://wirecloud.conwet.fi.upm.es/ns/macdescription/1" vendor="Wirecloud" name="objectstorage-test-widget" version="1.0">

## Connecting with the KeyStone Server

.fx: section-title

---
<!-- SLIDE 8 -->
## Connecting with the KeyStone Server

To start using the ObjectStorage, first you have to set up the connection with the KeyStone server. To do so, you should create a new `KeystoneAPI`:

	!javascript
	var keystone = new KeystoneAPI(url, options)

See the [ObjectStorage Javascript API documentation](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/object_storage_api/) for the full list of supported options but, as summary, the `url` is the ObjectStorage Server location. Also, if you are connecting to a ObjectStorage instance using the IdM authentication, you will need to pass the required authentication credentials. This can be accomplished in two ways:

* Making use of the `token` option and passing directly the required Authentication header
* Making use of the `use_user_fiware_token` option to make the ObjectStorage use the token obtained by WireCloud from the IdM

---
<!-- SLIDE 9 -->
## Connecting with the KeyStone Server

This example shows you how to connect with the KeyStone server using the resources available in the FIWARE Testbed. Note that the Keystone URL used is the one obtained from the preferences:

	!javascript
	var keystone = new KeystoneAPI(MashupPlatform.prefs.get('keystone_url'), {
    	use_user_fiware_token: true
	});

---


## Getting all the available tenants for the users

.fx: section-title

---
<!-- SLIDE 11 -->
## Getting all the available tenants for the users

Once that you are connected with the KeyStone server, you have to take into account is that a user can use several tenants to store the information. To get the list of available tenants for a user, you can use the `getTenants` function:

	!javascript
	keystone.getTenants([options])

The `options` argument allows you to set two callbacks:

* `onSuccess` is called when the request finishes successfully. This function will receive a dictionary with the field tenants that contains all the available tenants for the user that make the request
* `onFailure` is called when the request finish with errors

---
<!-- SLIDE 12 -->
## Getting all the available tenants for the users

In the following example, we call the function with both callbacks. If the request finish successfully, we will show the id of the first available tenant. Otherwise, we will show a message error:

	!javascript
	keystone.getTenants({
		onSuccess: function(data) {
			document.getElementById('tenantId').textContent = data.tenants[0].id;
		},
		onFailure: function () {
			document.getElementById('tenantId').textContent = 'Fail';
		}
	});

---


## Getting the authentication token

.fx: section-title

---
<!-- SLIDE 14 -->
## Getting the authentication token

When you have selected the tenant that you want to use, you must get an authentication token using the `getAuthToken` function:

	!javascript
	keystone.getAuthToken([options])

`options` argument include the following fields:

- `tenantName`: name of the tenant to be associated to the generated token. Both
  the `tenantId` and `tenantName` attributes are optional, but should not be
  specified together
- `tenantId`: The `id` of the tenant to be associated to the generated token.
  Both the 'tenantId' and 'tenantName' attributes are optional, but should not
  be specified together
- `onSuccess`: called when the request finishes successfully. This function will
  receive two parameters:
    - `new_token`: the new token obtained that you can use to access the
      ObjectStorage
    - `data`: the catalogue of available services for the tenant
- `onFailure`: called when the request finish with errors

---
<!-- SLIDE 15 -->
## Getting the authentication token

The next snippet shows you how to use this function. In this case we will use the tenant id obtained in the previous code. Note that we will also process the data parameter in order to get the ObjectStorage URL:

	!javascript
	keystone.getAuthToken({
		tenantId: data.tenants[0].id,
		onSuccess: function (new_token, data) {
			for (i = 0; i < data.access.serviceCatalog.length; i++) {
				if (data.access.serviceCatalog[i].type === 'object-store') {
					object_storage = data.access.serviceCatalog[i].endpoints[0].publicURL;
				}
			}
		},
		onFailure: function () {
			document.getElementById('api_token').textContent = 'Fail';
		}
	});

<!-- SLIDE 17 -->
## Connecting with the ObjectStorage Server

Once that you have the URL of the ObjectStorage server, we can connect to it. To do so, we must use the following function:

	!javascript
	objectStorage = ObjectStorageAPI(url)

In our case we have saved the ObjectStorage Server URL in the `object_storage` variable, so our code should be the following one:

	!javascript
	objectStorage = ObjectStorageAPI(object_storage)

---

## Listing the content available in a container

.fx: section-title

---
<!-- SLIDE 19 -->
## Listing the content available in a container

When we are connected to a ObjectStorage Server, we are able to list all the content available in a container. To do so, we should use the `listContainer` function:

	!javascript
	objectStorage.listContainer(container[, options])

The `container` argument is the name of the container while the `options`
argument should contain the following fields:

- `token`: The token obtained previously in the `getAuthToken` function
- `onSuccess`: called when the request finishes successfully. This function
  receives as argument the list of available files in the container
- `onFailure`: called when the request finish with errors

---
<!-- SLIDE 20 -->
## Listing the content available in a container

In the next example, we will show we will get the available files in the
integrationTests container, and we will show the name of the first one.

	!javascript
	objectStorage.listContainer('integrationTests', {
		token: token,

		onSuccess: function(file_list) {
			document.getElementById('file_name').textContent = file_list[0].name;
		},

		onFailure: function () {
			document.getElementById('file_count').textContent = 'Fail';
		}
	});

---

## Uploading a file

.fx: section-title

---
<!-- SLIDE 22 -->
## Uploading a file

If you are connected to the ObjectStorage, you can also upload a file easily. To
do so, you must use the uploadFile function:

	!javascript
	objectStorage.uploadFile(container, file[, options])

`container` is the name where the `file` is going to be uploaded, while file is
the content to be uploaded. The `options` argument should contain the following
fields:

- `token`: The `token` obtained previously in the `getAuthToken` function
- `file_name`: The name used to save the uploaded content in the `container`
- `onSuccess`: called when the request finishes successfully. This function does
  not receive any arguments
- `onFailure`: called when the request finish with errors

---
<!-- SLIDE 23 -->
## Uploading a file

Here you can see how to upload a text file containing "Hello world!".

	!javascript
	var blob = new Blob(["Hello world!"], { type: "text/plain" });
	objectStorage.uploadFile('integrationTests', blob, {
		token: token,
		file_name: 'test1.txt',
		onSuccess: function() {
			document.getElementById('file_upload').textContent = 'OK';
		},
		onFailure: function () {
			document.getElementById('file_upload').textContent = 'Fail';
		}
	});

---


## Deleting a file

.fx: section-title

---
<!-- SLIDE 25 -->
## Deleting a file

It's useful to upload a file, but in some occasions you will want to delete it.
To do so, you have to use the `deleteFile` function:

	!javascript
	objectStorage.deleteFile(container, file_name[, options])

`container` is the name of the container where the file is going to be deleted
while `file_name` is the name of the file to delete. The `options` argument
should contain the following fields:

- `token`: The token obtained previously in the `getAuthToken` function
- `onSuccess`: called when the request finishes successfully. This function does
  not receive any arguments
- `onFailure`: called when the request finish with errors

---
<!-- SLIDE 26 -->
## Deleting a file

The following example shows how to delete the file that we have created in the
previous step:

	!javascript
	objectStorage.deleteFile('integrationTests', file_name, {
		token: token,
		onSuccess: function() {
			document.getElementById('file_deletion').textContent = 'OK';
		},
		onFailure: function () {
			document.getElementById('file_deletion').textContent = 'Fail';
		}
	});

## Test it yourself!

We think that the best way to learn to use this feature is using it. For this
reason we offer you a very simple example based on this guide. Check the code
and modify as you like and test if it works. This widget will only work if you
create a instanceTests container before running it, otherwise it will fail.
