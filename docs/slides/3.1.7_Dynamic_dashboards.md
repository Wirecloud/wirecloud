## Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to use the Dashboard Management API from
widgets and operators by providing some examples of what can be done by using
it.

Widgets and operators using the Dashboard Management API will be able to add new
widgets/operators to the current dashboards. Widget and operators using the
Dasbhaord Management API will have full control over the created widgets and
operators. For example, they will be able to configure the wiring connections,
close them, assigning custom values to their preferences, etc.

You can find the reference documentation of the Dashboard Management API on the
[WidgetAPI documentation] (Search `DashboardManagement` to discover the relevant
documentation sections).

<!-- SLIDE 3 -->
## Enabling the Dashboard Management API

The first step for being able to use the Dashboard Management API is to add the
`DashboardManagement` feature as a requirement of the widget/operator.

For example, if you use the xml version of the MACDL this is done by adding the
following code inside the `<widget>` or `<operator>` element (depending if you
are adding this feature into a widget or an operator):

```xml
<requirements>
    <feature name="DashboardManagement"/>
</requirements>
```

## Videoconference example
### Introduction

This example will show you how to use the *Kurento one2one* widget for providing
videoconferece support into a thrid party widget.

The steps for adding that functionallity are:

1. Enable the Dasbhoard Management API (as shown in the previous section)
2. Add the *Kurento One2one* widget into the current dashboard
3. Create some dynamic endpoints on the thrid party widget/operator
4. Connect those endpoints with the ones provided by the *Kurento One2one*
widget
5. Wait until the *Kurento One2one* connects with the kurento service
6. Start the videoconference by sending a call event to the *Kurento One2one* widget

---
## Videoconference example
### Adding the one2one widget

You can add the *Kurento One2one* widget to the current dashboard using the
[`addWidget` method][addWidget]. For example, using the following code:

```javascript
var widget = MashupPlatform.mashup.addWidget('CoNWeT/kuernto-one2one/1.0', {
    "permissions": {
        "close": false,
        "configure": false
    },
    "preferences": {
        "stand-alone": {
            "value": false
        }
    },
    "top": "0px",
    "left": "66%"
});
```

---

## Videoconference example
### Adding the one2one widget

The previous code will add the *Kurento One2one* widget placed it at an static
position: 0px, 66%. Also, we are using the `permissions` option to block users
to configure and close the *Kurento One2one* widget. By using the `preferences`
options, we are configuring it in non-standalone mode.

If you are adding the videoconference support into a widget, probably you are
creating the videoconference because the user has clicked some button. A better
alternative to to use the `top` and `left` options, in this case, is to use the
`refposition` option. This way, the *Kurento One2one* widget will be placed near
the button the user has clicked.

---

## Videoconference example
### Adding the one2one widget

To use the `refposition` option, you have to obtain a `ClientRect` instance
representing your button, you can obtain such an object by using the
[`getBoundingClientRect`][getBoundingClientRect] method:

```javascript
var one2one_widget = MashupPlatform.mashup.addWidget('CoNWeT/kuernto-one2one/1.0', {
    "permissions": {
        "close": false,
        "configure": false
    },
    "preferences": {
        "stand-alone": {
            "value": false
        }
    },
    "refposition": button.getBoundingClientRect()
});
```

## Videoconference example
### Wiring configuration

We can make use the enpoints defined in the widget/operator description
(`config.xml` file) for connecting with the *Kurento One2one* widget, so it's
not mandatory to create new endpoints in a dynamic way. However, by creating
them using the Dashboard Management API we are declaring that they are going to
be used exclusively from the widget/operator code: Users won't be able to create
connections using those endpoint in the *Wiring Editor* view.

---

## Videoconference example
### Wiring configuration

The needed endpoints can be created using this code:

```javascript
var call_endpoint = MashupPlatform.widget.createOutputEndpoint();
var state_endpoint = MashupPlatform.widget.createInputEndpoint(function (state) {
    if (state === 'REGISTERED') {
        // Update the call button that tiggered the videoconference to become a
        // hang button. This button should call one2one_widget.remove() to end
        // the videoconference

        // By sending this event, the one2one widget will start the videoconferece
        call_endpoint.pushEvent(information.username);
    } else if (state === 'ENABLED_CALL') {
        one2one_widget.remove();
    }
});
```

> **Note**: If you are developing an operator you should use
> `MashupPlatform.operator.createOutputEndpoint` and
> `MashupPlatform.operator.createInputEndpoint` instead.

---

## Videoconference example
### Wiring configuration

The connection between those dynamic endpoint and the endpoints of the
*Kurento One2one* widget can be established using the following code:

```javascript
call_endpoint.connect(one2one_widget.inputs['call-user']);
one2one_widget.outputs['call-state'].connect(state_endpoint);
```

## Map example

.fx: section-title

## Map example
### Introduction

This example will show you how to use the *Map viewer* widget for displaying
some Point of Interest in a map in a dynamic way (without displaying a map
viewer widget all the time).

The main difference with the previous example is that in this case, we are going
to use a *NGSI Entity 2 PoI* operator for transforming the event data to be
compatible with the one expected by the *Map Viewer* widget.

---

## Map example
### Adding the Map viewer widget

This step can be accomplished in the same way as we did with the *Kurento One2one* widget:

```javascript
var map_widget = MashupPlatform.mashup.addWidget('CoNWeT/map-viewer/2.5.7', {
    "permissions": {
        "close": false,
        "configure": false
    },
    "preferences": {
        "stand-alone": {
            "value": false
        }
    },
    "top": "0px",
    "left": "66%"
});
```

Remember to use `refposition` in replacement of the `top` and `left` options if
applicable.

---

## Map example
### Adding the NGSI entity to PoI operator

The [`addOperator` method][addOperator] works in a very similar way to the
`addWidget` operator. E.g. for adding the *NGSI Entity 2 PoI* operator, we can
make use of the following code:

```javascript
var operator = MashupPlatform.mashup.addOperator('CoNWeT/ngsientity2poi/3.0.3', {
    "preferences": {
        "coordinates_attr": {
            "value": "position"
        }
    }
});
```

> **Note**: Rembember to change the `coordinates_attr` value according to your
> requirements.

---

## Map example
### Wiring configuration

```javascript
var poi_endpoint = MashupPlatform.widget.createOutputEndpoint();

poi_endpoint.connect(operator.inputs['entityInput']);
operator.outputs['poiOutput'].connect(map_widget.inputs['poiInput']);
```

Now you can send events using `poi_endpoint`. E.g.:

```javascript
poi_endpoint.pushEvent(JSON.stringify({
    "id": "Big Ben",
    "position": "51.5008715, -0.1259872"
});
```
