## Translating WireCloud

You need to download WireCloud's source code from the github repository:

	!bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/Wirecloud/wirecloud.git

---

## Translating WireCloud

Next step is creating or updating the catalogue of messages to translate, this can be accomplished with the following commands:

	!bash
	$ cd <wirecloud_repo_path>/src
	$ cd <module>
	$ django-admin.py makemessages -l <locale>
	$ django-admin.py makemessages -l <locale> -d djangojs

Where:

* `wirecloud_repo_path` is the path where the working copy of the WireCloud's git repository has been downloaded
* `module` is the django module to translate. In WireCloud there are 3 core modules:
	* wirecloud/commons
	* wirecloud/catalogue
	* wirecloud/platform
* `locale` is the locale of the messages files that are going to be created/updated. e.g. "es_MX"  for Mexican Spanish, "de" for German,  ...

## Translating WireCloud

You will be able to edit the `django.po` and `djangojs.po` files located at `wirecloud_repo_path>/<module>/locale/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/`, after running the command of the previous slide. Those files can be edited manually or any generic PO file editor.

Once you feel comfortable with your translated message catalogue, you can compile it for testing purporses by running the following code (for each module):

	!bash
	$ cd <wirecloud_repo_path>/src
	$ cd <module>
	$ django-admin.py compilemessages

---

## Translating WireCloud

After compiling messages, you can test it by running WireCloud. As we're developing, the recommended way is by executing the runserver command:

	!bash
	$ python manage.py runserver --insecure
