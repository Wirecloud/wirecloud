## Introduction

The latest version of the XML Schema described in the following sections is available at:

-   [Mashable application component description language XML Schema]

Mashable application components descriptions use the `http://wirecloud.conwet.fi.upm.es/ns/macdescription/1` namespace
for the root element. The name of the root element varies depending on the type of the component: `widget`, `operator`
or `mashup`. Whereas it always require the following attributes:

-   `vendor`: The id of the vendor/distributor of the mashable application component. It cannot contain the character
    "/".
-   `name`: Name of the mashable application component. It cannot contain the character "/".
-   `version`: Current version of the mashable application component. It must define starting sequences of numbers
    separated by dots. Moreover, zeros can only be used alone (e.g. 0.1 is valid but 03.2 is not). Following a release
    number, you can have a pre-release tag. A pre-release tag is a serie of letters: a (alpha), b (beta) or rc (release
    candidate); followed by digits. Pre-release tags make a version be considered older than the version they are
    appended to. So, revision 2.4 is newer than revision 2.4rc1, which in turn is newer than 2.4b1 or 2.4a1.

These tree fields (`vendor`, `name` and `version`) uniquely identify the mashable application component, therefore there
can not be a repetition of such identifier in any collection of WireCloud components (including widgets, mashups,
operators, ...).

## Common metadata

### details element

![](../images/mac_description_details_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `details` element</div>

Mashable application components descriptions should provide generic information about what you will obtain by using it,
information about who develops the component, etc... All this generic information is provided through the `details`
element. This element can contain any of the following elements:

-   `title`: Name used in the user interface for the mashup application component. Used for example when listing
    mashable application components. This field can be translated, therefore this field is not used to uniquely identify
    the mashable application component. This field is also uses as the default title for widgets added to workspaces.
-   `authors`: Comma separated list of developers, e.g.:

        √Ålvaro Arranz, Aitor Magan

    You can also provide an email and/or an url:

        Barney Rubble <b@rubble.com> (http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/)

-   `contributors`: Comma separated list of contributors. Same format than the authors field.
-   `email`: E-mail address for getting support. It is recommend to provide, at least, this field or the issuetracker as
    these fields are helpful for people who encounter issues with the component.
-   `license`: Name of the license associated to the mashable application component.
-   `licenseurl`: Absolute or description-file-relative URL pointing to the full license document.
-   `description`: A brief textual description of the mashable application component.
-   `longdescription`: Relative path to a markdown file describing the mashable application component.
-   `changelog`: Relative path to a markdown file detailing the changes made to the mashable application component in
    each version.
-   `image`: Absolute or description-file-relative URL of the mashable application component image for the catalogue.
    (170x80px)
-   `smartphone`: Image to be used in smartphones. (59x60px)
-   `doc`: Relative path to the markdown file containing the mashable application component documentation. For backwards
    compatibility, this field also supports an absolute URL to the documentation of the component (pointing to a web
    page).
-   `issuetracker`: Absolute URL to the component's issue tracker. It is recommend to provide, at least, this field or
    the `email` one as these fields are helpful for people who encounter issues with the component.

### The `requirements` element

![](../images/mac_description_requirements_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `requirements` element</div>

The `requirements` element is used for declaring on which features the component depends on. Currently those features
are associated with the injection (by WireCloud) of the API required for accessing a given feature (e.g. a widget can
depend on the NGSI feature to notify WireCloud it requires the injection of the NGSI API). In future releases of the
Application Mashup GE this element will provide support for adding other kind of dependencies (e.g. with another
mashable application component), but for now this element only accepts `feature` sub-elements.

#### The `feature` element

-   `name`: Name of the feature required by the application mashup component.

## Platform-component interaction elements

To guarantee the platform-component interaction, templates also define a set of elements that components use to get
connected to the environment and set different platform options. Likewise, it also defines some other interface
elements, such as the initial widget size. They are all managed by the platform, which will ensure their persistence.

Let us go through all these elements:

### The `preferences` element

The first platform-related element is the `preferences` one:

![](../images/mac_description_preferences_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `preferences` element</div>

It defines user preferences, which may be changed through the platform interface. This element is made up of one, many
or none `preference` sub-elements. This defines the actual user preference. It requires the following attributes:

-   `type`: preference data type: `text` (string), `number`, `boolean`, `password` and `list`.
-   `name`: name of the preference to be referenced in the source code.
-   `label`: text that the preference will show in the user interface.
-   `description`: text that describes the preference.
-   `default`: preference default value.
-   `readonly`: indicates whether this preference can be modified.
-   `value`: initial value. If not specified, the default value will be used as the initial value.
-   `secure`: access to the value of this preference is disallowed if the value of this attribute is true (the value of
    this preference will be usable through the Application Mashup cross-domain proxy). default: `false`.

If the `type` attribute is set to `list`, the different choices are defined by means of the `option` element. It has the
following attributes:

-   `label`: text to be displayed in the selection list.
-   `value`: value to be used when the option is selected.

### The persistentvariables element

The next XML element is the `persistentvariables` element. Its main purpose is to define a set of variables to store the
state of the widget/operator while it is executing, in order to have it available for future executions. Its structure
is shown in the figure below:

![](../images/mac_description_persistentvariables_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `persistentvariables` element</div>

This element is made up of a list of `variable` elements that require the following attributes:

-   `name`: property name.
-   `type`: property data type: only `text` (string) datatype does make sense in here.
-   `label`: text to be displayed in the user interface.
-   `description`: Descriptive text.
-   `secure`: Access to the value of this persistent variable is disallowed if the value of this attribute is true (the
    value of this variable will be usable through the Application Mashup cross-domain proxy). default: `false`.
-   `multiuser`: This persisten value will store it's own value for each user with access rigths to the dashboard.

### The wiring element

This is probably one of the most important elements. It defines both the inputs and outputs needed by widgets/operators
to intercommunicate with other widgets/operators. The Application Mashup GE implementation must take this information
into account to manage and control the wiring mechanism and its internal data flow.

The figure below depicts the `wiring` element:

![](../images/mac_description_wiring_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `wiring` element</div>

This element may contain any number of `inputendpoint` and `outputendpoint` elements.

Widgets and operators may send data (events) through an output endpoint. To do so, they must declare the endpoint using
the `outputendpoint` element. These elements have the following attributes:

-   `name`: output endpoint name.
-   `type`: output endpoint data type: only `text` (string) datatype does make sense in here.
-   `label`: text to be displayed in the user interface.
-   `description`: text that describes the output.
-   `friendcode`: One or more space-separated keywords used as output endpoint tags: it will help the platform to make
    suggestions in the wiring process.

On the other hand, widgets and operators can receive asynchronous data through the input endpoints. These endpoints are
meant to be used by widgets and operators for receiving data (events) coming from other widgets/operators. The
`inputendpoint` element supports the following attributes:

-   `name`: input endpoint name.
-   `type`: input endpoint data type: only `text` (string) datatype does make sense in here.
-   `label`: text to be displayed in the user interface.
-   `actionlabel`: short text that describes what is going to happen if an event is sent to this input endpoint. Widgets
    could use this text in buttons, selection boxes, etc... allowing end users to select what to do (and the widget will
    send an event to the associated target endpoint)
-   `description`: text that describes the input.
-   `friendcode`: One or more space-separated keywords used as input endpoint tags: it will help the platform to make
    suggestions in the wiring process.

## Specific Widget metadata

The figure below depicts the structure followed by `widget` elements (and therefore, the structure followed by widget
descriptions):

![](../images/mac_description_widget_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">widget structure</div>

### The `contents` element

Widget descriptions must link to the actual source code of the widget. This is done through the `contents` element.

![](../images/mac_description_content_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `content` element binds the description with the actual widget source code</div>

The `contents` element supports the following attributes:

-   `src`: absolute or description-file-relative URL of widget code.
-   `contenttype`: linked resource content type: suggested values are: `text/html` and `application/xml+xhtml`. This is
    an optional attribute, with `text/html` by default. All implementations of the Application Mashup GE must support
    HTML files (`text/html`), other options (like SVG or Flash are optional).
-   `charset`: Charset used by the source file. This is an optional attribute, with `utf-8` by default.
-   `cacheable`: sets if the linked code can be cached by the platform: possible values are `true` and `false`. This is
    an optional attribute, `true` by default.
-   `useplatformstyle`: Use platform style to display HTML elements. Optional attribute, `false` by default.

In addition to these attributes, the `contents` element allows to provide a list of extra source files (through the
`altcontents` subelement) that will be use instead of the one provided in the main `contents` element if the conditions
are met (controlled by the `scope` attribute).

### The `rendering` element

The `rendering` element specifies the default width and height of the widget once it is deployed in the user workspace.

![](../images/mac_description_content_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `rendering` element</div>

The `contents` element supports the following attributes:

-   `width`: initial width of the widget as layout columns. From Wirecloud v0.8.0 you can use also pixel units (e.g.
    `200px`) and percentage units (e.g. `30%`). It's recommended to use pixel or percentage units if you don't need to
    support previous versions of WireCloud.
-   `height`: initial height of the widget as layout rows. From Wirecloud v0.8.0 you can use also pixel units (e.g.
    `200px`) and percentage units (e.g. `30%`). It's recommended to use pixel or percentage units if you don't need to
    support previous versions of WireCloud.

## Specific Operator metadata

The figure below depicts the structure followed by `operator` elements (and therefore, the structure followed by
operator descriptions):

![](../images/mac_description_operator_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `operator` element</div>

### The `scripts` element

While in widgets define it code entry point, in general, through an HTML file, operators, as they do not provide an user
interface, need to declare directly the list of javascript files to use. This script list is declared using the
`scripts` element that is composed of one or more `script` sub-elements. `script` elements supports the following
attributes:

-   `src`: description-file-relative URL of the JavaScript file.

## Specific Mashup metadata

The figure below depicts the structure followed by `mashup` elements (and therefore, the structure followed by mashup
descriptions):

![](../images/mac_description_mashup_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `mashup` element</div>

### The `structure` element

The `structure` element is in charge of describing the structure of the mashup. The figure below depicts what it looks
like:

![](../images/mac_description_structure_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `structure` element</div>

The `preferencevalue` element allows the modification of the initial values of the preferences of the final workspace.

The `tab` element is used for describing each of the tab that build up the mashup. So this is the key element for
describing the visual part of a mashup.

The `wiring` element is used for describing the wiring/piping configuration of the mashup. This element also is used for
describing the operators used in the mashup. Note that this element has the same name to the `wiring` element used on
the root of the description, but this element is different in structure.

### The `tab` element

![](../images/mac_description_tab_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The `tab` element</div>

The `structure` element should contain at least one `tab` element that represents tabs in Application Mashup GE
dashboard. It has the following attributes

-   `name`: the name of the tab
-   `id`: the identification of the tab; this id is internal to the description.

The `tab` element may contain any number of `resource` elements which represent widget instances used in the mashup. It
has the following attributes:

-   `vendor`: the widget distributor
-   `name`: name of the widget
-   `version`: version of the widget
-   `title`: name to be displayed in the dashboard.
-   `readonly`: indicates if the widget can be remove from the dashboard.
-   `id`: the widget identification; this id is internal to the mashup description.

The `preferencevalues` and the `variablevalues` elements allows the modification of the initial values and the behaviour
of the preferences an persistent variables respectively. The parametrisation of each preference/persistent variable is
controlled by one of those elements and their attributes:

-   `name`: name of the preference/persisten variable to parameterise.
-   `value`: initial value for the preference/persistent variable. If not provided, the initial value of the preference
    (obtained from the widget description) will be used.
-   `readonly`: indicates if the preference/persistent variable can be modified.
-   `hidden`: indicates if the user will be able to see the value for this preference/persistent variable on the user
    interface of the Application Mashup GE.

The `position` element describes the widget position into the dashboard. It has the following attributes:

-   `x`: the widget's X coordinate.
-   `y`: the widget's Y coordinate.
-   `z`: the widget's Z coordinate.

The `rendering` element describes some characteristics of the widget representation. It has the following attributes:

-   `width`: widget width in the dashboard.
-   `minimized`: Boolean attribute that defines whether the widget is minimized in the dashboard
-   `layout`: widget layout in the dashboard
-   `height`: widget height in the dashboard
-   `fulldragboard`: Boolean attribute that describes whether the widget is using all the dashboard.

##### The Mashup's `wiring` structure element

This element describes how widgets and operators in the mashup are connected using their output and input endpoints.

![](../images/mac_description_mashup_wiring_element.png)

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The mashup `wiring` element</div>

The `wiring` element may contain any number of `operator` elements. An `operator` element defines an operator that is
used in the wiring. It has the following attributes:

-   `id`: identification of the operator; this id is internal to the mashup description.
-   `vendor`: the distributor of the operator.
-   `name`: operator name.
-   `version`: version of the operator.

Fields `vendor`, `name` and `version` follows the same pattern defined in the [introduction](#introduction).

The `wiring` element may contain any number of `connection` elements. These elements describe which output endpoints are
connected with which input endpoints. The `connection` elements are composed of a `source` element and a `target`
element.

The `source` element defines the output endpoint of the connection. It has the following attributes.

-   `type`: type of the element that has the output endpoint; this attribute could have the values `widget` or
    `operator`.
-   `id`: id of the element that has the output endpoint; this id is the same as the id defined in the `resource`
    element if the element is a widget, whereas this id is the same as the id defined in the `operator` element if the
    element is an operator.
-   `endpoint`: the name of the output endpoint. This name is the same as the defined in the `outputenpoint` element.

The `target` element defines the input endpoint of the connection. It has the following attributes:

-   `type`: type of element that has the input endpoint; the possible values of this attribute are `widget` or
    `operator`.
-   `id`: id of the element that has the input endpoint; this id is the same as the id defined in the `resource` element
    if the element is a widget, whereas this id is the same as the id defined in the `operator` element if the element
    is an operator.
-   `endpoint`: the name of the input endpoint; this name is the same as the defined in the `inputenpoint` element.
