First of all, you need to download WireCloud's source code from the github
repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wirecloud/wirecloud.git
```

Once you have the source code to translate, next step is creating or updating
the catalogue of messages to translate, this can be accomplished with the
following commands:

```bash
cd ${wirecloud_repo_path}/src
cd ${module}
django-admin makemessages -l ${locale}
django-admin makemessages -l ${locale} -d djangojs
```

Where:

- `${wirecloud_repo_path}` is the path where the working copy of the WireCloud's
  git repository has been downloaded.

- `${module}` is the django module to translate. Currently, WireCloud has
  translations catalogues in the following modules:

    - `wirecloud/commons`
    - `wirecloud/catalogue`
    - `wirecloud/platform`

- `${locale}` is the locale of the messages files that are going to be
  created/updated. e.g. `es_MX`  for Mexican Spanish, `de` for German, ...

After running these command, you will be able to edit the `django.po` and
`djangojs.po` files located at
`${wirecloud_repo_path}/${module}/locale/${locale}/LC_MESSAGES/`. Those files
can be edited manually or by using a generic PO file editor.

Once you feel comfortable with your translated message catalogue, you can
compile it for testing purporses by running the following commands (for each
module):

```bash
cd ${wirecloud_repo_path}/src
cd ${module}
django-admin compilemessages
```

After compiling messages, you can test them by running WireCloud. As we're
developing, the recommended way is by executing the runserver command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver --insecure
```

You have several choices for contributing your translations. First, if you feel
comfortable sending github pull request, this is the preffered way, followed by
sending directly the patches/commits by email to wirecloud at conwet dot com.
Another option is sending the full `po` files by email.
