Before starting the creation of a widget, the developer should be aware of certain design principles of the widgets:

-   Widgets are supposed to be small, reusable and user centric web applications.
-   Generic widgets are desirable, but ad-hoc solutions are allowed too if they are quick and cheap enough.
-   Widgets should be adapted to real problems.
-   Widgets are mainly elements of the front-end layer (View). Widgets can access backend services directly, but is
    preferred to create operators when possible for those tasks. Then those widgets and operators can be connected by
    making use of the wiring editor.
-   During the development of widgets any technology accepted by web browsers (XHTML, JavaScript, SVG, Flash, applets
    ....) can be used.

Widgets can be split up into three different components:

-   A Descriptor (`config.xml`), which is a declarative description of the widget. This file contains, among other
    things, references to the rest of resources of the widget. This description file is written using the Mashable
    Application Component Description Language (a.k.a [MACDL](macdl.md)).
-   Code, composed of HTML files, JavaScript files, CSS files, SVG files ...: those files contains the implementation of
    the widget and they work exactly if you were creating a standard web page. The only thing to take into account is
    that your code will have access to a new API: the [Widget API](../widgetapi/widgetapi.md).
-   Static resources, such as images, documentation and other static resources.

All those files should be packaged together into a zip file (usually renamed to use the `.wgt` extension). The following
figure shows one possible structure of files for a widget:

```text
.
+-- docs
|   |   ...
|   +-- index.md
+-- css
|   |   ...
|   +-- style.css
+-- images
|   |   ...
|   +-- catalogue.png
+-- js
|   |   ...
|   +-- main.js
+-- CHANGELOG.md
+-- config.xml
+-- index.html
+-- DESCRIPTION.md
```

> It's recommended to use this kind of structure (or a similar one), but you can use whatever you want, except that the
> `config.xml` file MUST be at the root of the zip file.

Operators are created in the same way as widgets, the only difference is that the descriptor file (`config.xml`) does
not link to an initial HTML document (as operators doesn't have a visual component). Instead, you will have to link the
list of used JavaScript files from the `config.xml` file.

Operators can be classified using three types:

-   **Data source operators:** Operators that provide information that can be consumed by other widgets/operators. For
    example, an operator that retrieves some type of information from a web service.
-   **Data target operators:** Operators that are provided information and use it to do some tasks. For example, an
    operator that receives some information and push it to a web service.
-   **Data transformation operators:** This type of operators can be very useful since they can transform data in order
    to make it usable by widgets or operators that expect data structure to be slightly different.

# Preparing your widget/operator projects

As you see, building a WireCloud widget/operator is a matter of editing some files and packaging them into a zip file,
so simple widgets/operators can be created using a simple editor and a zip tool.

However, you will need a more sophisticated schema if you want to pass unit tests, deploy widgets/operators
automatically, etc.

WireCloud provides the following tools to ease this process:

-   A [mock of the Widget API](https://github.com/Wirecloud/mock-applicationmashup), so you can pass your unit tests
    without having to deploy your widget/operator into a WireCloud instance.
-   A [set of tools for grunt](https://github.com/Wirecloud/grunt-wirecloud) allowing you to deploy widgets and
    operators using grunt tasks.
-   A [grunt-init template for operator projects](https://github.com/Wirecloud/grunt-init-wirecloud-operator) and
    another [grunt-init template for widget projects](https://github.com/Wirecloud/grunt-init-wirecloud-widget).
    Projects created using those templates, will make use of the Widget API mock and
    [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for unit testing the widget/operator, [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for building
    it and grunt-wirecloud for deploying it. Remember that you can always fork those templates for adapting them to your
    needs (or requesting new features, bug fixes, etc. through the issue tracker of the template repo).
-   An [Eclipse plugin](eclipse_ide.md) for those preferring a full IDE.

# What next?

We recommend you to continue following the
[WireCloud course at the FIWARE Academy](https://fiware-academy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processing/wirecloud/index.html), as we think that it's easier to
learn by examples. Anyway, the following sections will provide the reference documentation for developing widgets and
operators for WireCloud.
